I wanted to take a moment to share an important update regarding our international shipping.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\r\\\\nI’m sad to inform you that we are temporarily pausing our international shipping options. As a small company, our focus has always been on providing the best possible experience for all our customers, and in recent years, we’ve tried to expand our reach to serve the international community. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we\\'ve faced significant challenges in maintaining the level of service we strive for.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\r\\\\nOver the past year, we introduced an international warehouse with the goal of reducing import taxes and improving the shipping experience for our global customers. While we were hopeful this would alleviate some of the burdens, the results haven’t aligned with our expectations. Ultimately, we’ve come to the decision to focus our efforts back on our domestic operations while we rethink how we can offer a consistent, cost-effective experience to our international community.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\r\\\\nWe deeply value your support and understand how disappointing this news may be. Please know that this is not a permanent change, and we are committed to revisiting our international strategy. Once we’ve developed a better solution, we will reach out with an update.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\r\\\\nIn the meantime, we’ll continue to work hard to deliver the best experience possible for our domestic customers, and we appreciate your understanding as we work through these growing pains.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\r\\\\nThank you for being a part of our journey. We’re incredibly grateful for your continued support, and we look forward to finding a way to serve you again in the future.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSome good news:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n- We are restocking Model 000 very soon. They will be ready to buy some time in May.

Please keep this revised version (both Word and PDF) as your final. You can disregard the previous one.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPlain text resumes are specifically designed for online job applications.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs you can see, they aren’t visually appealing; there are no visual design elements such as bold fonts or bullet points. They are ideal for online job because they make it easy to copy and paste information into fields.\\\\r\\\\nI don’t know if you ever came across those job applications where you’re required to upload your resume and enter the same information in the fields provided.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUsually, you’ll need to type that information manually into the fields, but now, you can just copy the information from your plain text version and paste it directly into those fields.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI’ve separated each section with dashes (--------) so the information stands out and it’ll be easier for you to find it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPlain text is also great if you’re ever asked to paste your resume on the body of an email. Some companies request that to avoid getting viruses in the files they receive.  This formatting is also great for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) since the information is easily readable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI’ll send you the blueprint for online applications early next week, since I’m revamping the old version, and I want you to have my most updated version. I’m still owing you your LinkedIn blueprint which is not ready yet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPlease note that I’ve reworded your achievement in a more compelling way. Since you mentioned that you’ve already put it where you accomplished it, please do the same with this version.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLast, but not least, I’ve managed to shorten your resume to two pages 😊\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHave a great weekend!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGiselle\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\'}, \\'1952ab90dab9831b\\': {\\'From\\': \\'LinkedIn Job Alerts <jobalerts-noreply@linkedin.com>\\',

You are witnessing history unfold. True to our launch announcement, this newsletter is not solely focused on AI agents—it is created by them. Our team of\\\\xa0seven specialized AI agents\\\\xa0functions as a digital newsroom, scanning and analyzing significant developments. I then curate and enhance each insight with strategic analysis for thorough coverage and expert insights. What is the simplest way to define AI Agents or Agentic AI? The word\\\\xa0agent\\\\xa0comes from the Latin \"agere,\" meaning\\\\xa0\"to do\" or \"to act.\" At its core, an agent is a system that can act autonomously. Agentic systems have been around for some time—driverless cars, robotic process automation (RPA), and even thermostats. They all sense, decide, and act without constant human input. But something has changed recently. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has given these agents a new kind of intelligence—the ability to understand goals, interpret context, and plan actions. This unlocks new ways they can assist us, from automating workflows to supporting our decision-making. In AGENTIC INTELLIGENCE, we explore this revolution—its opportunities, risks, and real-world impact—one issue at a time. This Week\\\\\\'s Agentic Breakthroughs: 💰 AI Marketplaces: The Gig Economy for AI Agents A new wave of AI marketplaces is emerging, where businesses can hire AI agents just like they hire freelancers—for content, coding, marketing, and data analysis. Key Points ✅ AI Agents freelancers can be hired on-demand, just like human gig workers. ✅ Businesses of all sizes can now afford AI-powered automation without expensive in-house teams. ✅ The model mirrors Upwork & Fiverr, but for AI-powered productivity. ✅ AI Agent labor is reshaping business efficiency, reducing operational costs and scaling output. Why it Matters This was inevitable. AI is no longer just software—it’s labor. These marketplaces democratize access to automation, allowing small businesses to scale at a fraction of the cost. To react to this trend, freelance platform Fiverr just\\\\xa0launched\\\\xa0Fiverr Go, a new suite of AI tools that lets gig human workers train models on their work to automate the production of their work. Soon, human gig workers will earn money by selling the services of the agents they own. The risk of all this? Job displacement. Traditional roles will be redefined, and the workforce must adapt fast. Agentic AI will be a tool, not a replacement—but only for those who learn to use it. 🛠 Postman AI Agent Builder: No-Code AI Development for Everyone Postman has launched a game-changing no-code AI agent builder, making AI development accessible for businesses of all sizes. Key Points ✅ Postman’s platform simplifies AI agent creation with a visual interface, eliminating the need for deep coding expertise. ✅ It integrates OpenAI\\\\\\'s ChatGPT and Google Gemini, allowing users to build agents that interact with these models seamlessly. ✅ Developers can test and optimize AI agents in real-time, reducing the trial-and-error phase. ✅ It features built-in ethical guardrails, ensuring that AI agents comply with best practices. Why it Matters This is huge. AI development has always been technical and fragmented—Postman’s platform is democratizing access. However, simplification brings risks—the easier it is to build AI, the higher the chance of poorly designed AI running unchecked. The challenge? Balancing accessibility with responsibility. We need better AI education to ensure people don’t create flawed agents that make dangerous mistakes. 🔮 Rabbit’s ‘Generalist’ AI Agent Changes How We Use Devices The Humane AI Pin has collapsed, but Rabbit is still kicking. The company published a blog post and video yesterday showing off a “generalist Android agent,” slowly controlling apps on a tablet in much the same way that Rabbit claimed its R1 device would over a year ago: Key Points ✅ Rabbit\\\\\\'s AI can now use multiple apps—from sending WhatsApp messages to updating notes, all from a single voice command. ✅ This is an AI-native approach to devices, removing friction in everyday tasks. ✅ Unlike Siri or Alexa, Rabbit AI is fully adaptable—it doesn’t just respond, it acts. Why it Matters This is exactly where AI should be heading—from passive assistants to active problem-solvers. Imagine an AI Agent that automatically manages your schedule, emails, and finances without constant human input. The challenge? AI agents must be\\\\xa0invisible yet reliable—if they break even once, trust is lost. The key is balance: intelligent automation that remains predictable, transparent, and user-controlled. 📈 Writesonic’s 24/7 AI SEO Agent: A Game-Changer for Digital Growth A fully autonomous AI SEO agent is now available, offering businesses affordable, AI-powered content optimization. Key Points ✅ The AI agent monitors rankings, updates keywords, and analyzes competitors 24/7. ✅ Replaces expensive SEO agencies, cutting costs significantly. ✅ Helps businesses climb Google’s rankings within weeks, leveraging real-time AI analysis. Why it Matters This is a huge unlock for small businesses and solo entrepreneurs. SEO is the backbone of digital success, but good SEO is expensive and time-consuming—Agentic AI is now automating it. The risk? If Google tweaks its algorithm against AI-generated content, businesses could see major ranking drops. The key will be blending AI efficiency with human creativity. ⚡ AI Agents Are Reshaping Telecom Networks AI agents\\\\xa0are now optimizing telecom infrastructure, predicting\\\\xa0network congestion, and securing systems in real-time. Key Points ✅ AI dynamically reroutes network traffic, preventing slowdowns before they happen. ✅ Telecom AI can self-heal outages, reducing human intervention. ✅ AI detects cyber threats in milliseconds, improving security. Why it Matters Telecom was overdue for disruption. Agentic AI is finally making networks smarter, faster, and more resilient. The next step? Integrating AI with edge computing to make networks even more predictive and adaptive. This isn’t just about speed—it’s about intelligent automation on a national scale. 🔮 McGill & Partners Launches AI Agent for Insurance A groundbreaking AI agent has entered the insurance industry, leveraging Salesforce’s Agentforce technology to improve client engagement, efficiency, and underwriting automation. Key Points ✅ First of its kind in London’s insurance market, using AI to optimize risk assessment and claims processing. ✅ Part of the Underscore platform, enhancing client interaction through data-driven, AI-enhanced decision-making. ✅ Redefining digital transformation, bringing AI-driven automation to one of the most traditional industries. Why it Matters This is a major breakthrough in AI-driven finance and insurance. The potential here is massive—faster claims processing, lower fraud risks, and more personalized policies. The concern? Over-reliance on AI risk assessments. If not balanced with human oversight, AI-led underwriting could lead to unfair exclusions. The solution? Augment AI with human judgment rather than replace it. 📈 The First Leaderboard to Compare Agent Model\\\\\\'s Efficiency Galileo Labs launched the first Agent Leaderboard\\\\xa0to evaluate AI models on tool-calling capabilities. AI agents are leveraging models at their core to be able to understand instructions, plan, and utilize tools. But, not all models are equally efficient at powering AI agents. Key Points ✅ It assesses\\\\xa017 models\\\\xa0across API usage, multi-tool interactions, and safety considerations. ✅ Gemini-2.0-flash and GPT-4o\\\\xa0lead in tool-calling efficiency, with open-source models improving. ✅ The benchmark is updated\\\\xa0monthly\\\\xa0to track AI advancements. Why it Matters AI agents are becoming essential for automation and business workflows, but not all models perform equally. This leaderboard provides a\\\\xa0clear benchmark for enterprises\\\\xa0to select the best AI for their needs. As AI capabilities evolve, businesses need up-to-date insights to\\\\xa0deploy the most effective solutions. 🧪 Google’s AI Co-Scientist: A Breakthrough in Scientific Discovery Google just\\\\xa0launched\\\\xa0an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent research assistant (built on Gemini 2.0) that accelerates scientific discoveries by generating and validating new hypotheses across areas like medicine, genetics, and more. Key Points ✅ Six AI agents work in parallel, handling hypothesis generation, validation, and peer review. ✅ Early trials at Stanford and Imperial College show promising results in drug discovery and genetics. ✅ The system outperforms human experts, achieving 80%+ accuracy on complex research problems. Why it Matters This marks the dawn of AI-assisted science. It’s not about replacing researchers but amplifying human intelligence—accelerating breakthroughs we might have taken decades to achieve. Recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said next-gen models will start discovering “new bits of scientific knowledge.” Google’s AI co-scientist now seems to be following that path. What we are seeing is the early stage of a new era where AI will serve as an integral part of scientists’ toolkits. ☢️ “Nuclear Deployed!” – AI Making High-Stakes Decisions A study published this week explored how AI agents could be used in nuclear decision-making—and whether they’d help or increase risks. Key Points ✅ AI agents can autonomously analyze threats, respond to high-risk scenarios, and simulate decision-making in war-like conditions. ✅ Major concerns over bias: AI models may interpret ambiguous threats as acts of war, increasing escalation risks. ✅ Ethical dilemmas: Who is accountable if an AI agent makes the wrong call in a crisis? ✅ Need for oversight: AI cannot replace human decision-making in life-or-death scenarios, but it can improve strategy modeling. Why it Matters This research highlights both AI’s power and its dangers. While AI can analyze threats faster than any human, we must never hand over the nuclear keys to an algorithm. AI should serve as an advisory tool, not an autonomous decision-maker. The future? AI helping defense strategies, but under human control—because the stakes are too high for anything else.

I’m proofreading your resume right now, will probably do a couple more changes (minor changes), and will send you the revised final version of your resume this afternoon together with your PDF and .TXT versions as well as your cover letter so you can start applying as soon as possible, so be on the lookout 😊.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJust so you know, your resume is a bit long as is, but remember that this is your foundational resume as I mentioned at the beginning. You’ll need to tailor it based on the jobs descriptions of your target roles, so whenever possible, if you see Skills that you currently have in your Skills section that don’t align with your target roles, just remove them so you can shorten your resume a little bit. I’ll try to reword a few bullet points and see if I can cut it down to two pages, but if I see that I lose important information by doing that I’ll leave it as is, just keep that in mind.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHave a wonderful day!

issue on my end and there’s nothing wrong with the links.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYes, your LinkedIn profile optimization is part of your package.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs described in the terms (you can see the link to the Terms of Purchase under each package), due to LinkedIn\\'s privacy terms and conditions (and privacy in general), I don\\'t work with the client\\'s log in details. If I would, the system would identify a different IP, and for every single change I make, it\\'ll send you an e-mail to confirm it\\'s you who\\'s logged into your profile which will make the process extremely long and inconvenient since people can\\'t be on-demand checking their e-mails and approving of changes.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe way I work, which I\\'ve found to be most effective and what most clients feel comfortable with, is by providing a step-by-step blueprint with content they can copy and paste directly onto their LinkedIn accounts. That said, some areas will require that you manually type the information in specific fields, such as the customized LinkedIn URL, and work experience; however, for the most part, you\\'re covered with the blueprint.\\\\r\\\\nWith this guide you\\'ll also learn how to optimize your profile to become searchable so recruiters and hiring managers can find you, something similar to appearing among the top results in Google searches.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRegarding your achievement, please let me know where did you accomplish that since achievements should be placed under the role where they happened and not as a standalone section.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHave a wonderful night! Will start working on the rest of your package tomorrow. I’ll try to get at least your cover letter ready so  you can start applying for jobs as soon as possible 😊\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGiselle\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFrom: Tristan Padiou <padioutristan@gmail.com>\\\\r\\\\nDate: Wednesday, February 19, 2025 at 3:53\\\\u202fPM\\\\r\\\\nTo: Giselle Bogs <giselleb@resumewritingbbc.com>\\\\r\\\\nSubject: Re: Resume Final Version\\\\r\\\\nHi Giselle,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThank you very much for the resume, it\\'s looking great!\\\\r\\\\nI tried the links and they seem to work.
